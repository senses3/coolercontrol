//! Device UID derivation.
//!
//! A Device UID is the stable identifier used as the key for all of a device's persisted settings,
//! so this logic is high-stakes and rarely changed: altering it re-keys existing configs. The
//! functions are associated with [`Device`] (call them as `Device::create_uid_from` /
//! `Device::assign_unique`), but their logic lives in this module so the reasoning is in one place.
//!
//! `create_uid_from` produces the UID as a sha256 hex hash of the `DeviceType` combined with a
//! caller-provided identifier:
//!
//!   - When the caller has a device-specific identifier (a hardware serial number or a stable sysfs
//!     path), it is passed as `device_id` and the hash is `DeviceType + device_id`. This is name-
//!     and order-independent, so the UID follows the same physical device across renames and
//!     reordering.
//!   - When no such identifier exists, the caller passes `None` and the hash falls back to
//!     `DeviceType + name + type_index`. This is a last resort: `type_index` is assigned in
//!     detection order, so the UID is not stable across hardware add/remove.
//!
//! The identifier priority (serial, then realpath, then name, etc.) is chosen by each repository,
//! since only it knows the hardware. This module owns how a chosen identifier becomes a UID.
//!
//! Including `DeviceType` in the hash means the same physical device seen through two subsystems
//! (for example the kernel hwmon driver and liquidctl) gets two distinct UIDs, matching how the
//! daemon models them as separate devices.
//!
//! Uniqueness is best-effort. We cannot always obtain a true per-device identifier, so two
//! indistinguishable devices (identical model, no serial, no distinct path) can derive the same
//! UID. `assign_unique` enforces uniqueness within a detection batch so that such a collision never
//! silently drops a device from a uid-keyed map.
